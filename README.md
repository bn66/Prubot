# Prubot
Prubot is a bot for the 2-D MMORPG, Tibia. Prubot uses the TibiaAPI project (https://github.com/ianobermiller/tibiaapi) 
written in C# and then the Python for .NET (http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/) to interface with the API. 

The bot provides a GUI to interface with common functions and uses a 'Priority Queue' structure to queue and prioritize commands.
